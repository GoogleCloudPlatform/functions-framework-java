/**
 * Represents a Cloud Function that is activated by an event and parsed into a user-supplied class.
 * The payload of the event is a JSON object, which is deserialized into a user-defined class as
 * described for
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md#TOC-Object-Examples">Gson</a>.
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of an implementation that accesses the {@code messageId} property from
 * a payload that matches a user-defined {@code PubSubMessage} class:
 *
 * <!-- The {@code} placement is a bit strange here, to prevent spurious spaces introduced by the
 *      javadoc tool. -->
 * <pre>
 * public class Example implements{@code BackgroundFunction<PubSubMessage>} {
 *   private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Example.class.getName());
 *
 *  {@code @Override}
 *   public void accept(PubSubMessage pubSubMessage, Context context) {
 *     logger.info("Got messageId " + pubSubMessage.messageId);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Where PubSubMessage is a user-defined class like this:
 * public class PubSubMessage {
 *   String data;
 *  {@code Map<String, String>} attributes;
 *   String messageId;
 *   String publishTime;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the class of payload objects that this function expects.
 */

   * Called to service an incoming event. This interface is implemented by user code to
   * provide the action for a given background function. If this method throws any exception
   * (including any {@link Error}) then the HTTP response will have a 500 status code.
   *
   * @param payload the payload of the event, deserialized from the original JSON string.
   * @param context the context of the event. This is a set of values that every event has,
